# NAASC Presentations and Notes
## BIS180L- Genomics Lab
A computer lab class at UC Davis in the genetics and genomics major. All class materials using open-source programming languages and materials. Students learn command line, git version control system for collaboration and turning in homework assignments using R-Markdown (autograde!).

## Data Visualization
This is an essential skill for large datasets. Elegant data visualization serves both producer and consumer of information. We are moving to interactive data visualization for everything. Static plots are great, but what if the consumer information wants to ask a different question? 

Data visualization Application for merging datasets by undergrad Tiffany Ho (now at Cornell in Buckler Lab).

## Digital Collaborative Project Management
Digitize everything related to a project and have it in one place. All my projects, meta-data, links to raw data, links to code repositories, and communication are in one place.

## R-Club
A weekly gathering of motivated students, post-docs and profs who want to learn more about a topic. Past topics have been visualization, data exploration, basic statistics. The current class if focusing on Bayesian statistics. Focused learning and discussion with assignments turned in prior to participating via github.

General Description: 
Space Rules: One room divided into two halves. The the learning half (blue)and the data half (red). Each half of the room has five themed tables: The blue tables are hardware, cloud computing, databases, image processing, data modeling. The red tables are are divided into the following classes: 3 tables have unsolved image based phenotyping problems, 1 table has solved image based phenotyping problems, 1 table is BYOD (bring your own data).

Time Rules: We need to have some initial starting conditions where people have a table to start at and need to stay there for at least X min. (1) each person is paired with another person based on their response to a questionnaire (learning objectives) They will not need to stay together for the whole event (1-2.5 days) but will we will cycle between pairs of people and have a duration where you get to float on your own. At the end, each person will give presentation on how they met their goals.

Details and side rules: Each "code bum" will be paired with another "code bum". Pairing will be done based on learning objectives. There will be two prizes for the "code guns", 1) Top prize will be for the code gun who gets the most tokens 2) Second Prize for the "code gun" who solves the unsolved problem. 5 Tokens will be given out to each "code bum" and they will deposit those tokens into a box with the name of the "code gun" who outlines a concept for them. The "Code Gun" who earns the most tokens wins something.
