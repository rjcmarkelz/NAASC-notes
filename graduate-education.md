Graduate
Skills and competencies needed for various positions:
-skills desired and bottlenecks encountered in terms of
For graduate education there is little
At a minimum students should also be trained to think algorithmically. 
Soft skills- interpersonal (collaborations or industry)


Biology. Molecular and Cell Biology, Genetics and Evolution, Organismal Biology
Computer science: see above and also clustering, classification, graph theory/networks, bioinformatic algorithms, ontologies and data resources
Mathematics: calculus refresher, linear algebra, differential equations
Statistics: probability computation, inference, hypothesis testing and correction for multiple testing, study design, distribution types, regression.
Integrated: capstone problem-solving course AND ethics and soft skills.

Computer science to plants
For computer scientists AND biologists: central dogma, basic molecular biology, genomics (RNA-seq, Y1H, sequencing...how these relate back to the central dogma- understanding the way things are measured can help e.g. with understanding why it might not be appropriate to merge specific data sets or matrices).
For computational biologists who are plant-curious: photosynthesis, plant physiology, genetics/breeding...
Possible resources:
Bioinformatic Data Skills (Vince Buffalo, O’Reiley; http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030157.do)
In the first year, mandatory trainings
NSF leverage
Understanding publications- how to write a good paper, a good thesis.
Where data should end up, how they’re formatted
d.     Should be integral in faculty education and training (particularly mid-career)?
Develop short courses for faculty
Faculty curriculum development- more awareness base and less skill-based.
1 day workshops for faculty, could be tie to Responsible Conduct for Research.
e.     Should be integral for those interested in industry/biotechnology? Ensure participation that accurately reflects diversity?
Team based projects:
Young entrepreneurs scheme- UK
iGEM- synthetic biology
DE has IGERT for engineered systems in cell; required internships where they addressed challenges posed by Industry.

graduate training fellowhips for training study; masters or certificates in a particular quantitative or biological emphasis after graduate school or after your bachelor’s; class size limitations - embracing small classes
Assessment: specific interview questions...how would you analyze these data etc? Journals regularly ask if you are able to evaluate the stats or need extra help. Good idea from Yellow Group: submissions to GitHub.
Skills generally useful (from our industry partner): teamwork, collaboration, communication, project management.
