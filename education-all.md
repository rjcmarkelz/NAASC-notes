# Undergraduate
############## 

At the undergraduate level, there is good agreement on the skills that undergraduates desire to attain for furthering their careers and the skills that researchers would like undergraduates to gain.  Ideally, undergraduate education would move in a holistic direction that better integrates foundational concepts from biological science, chemistry, mathematics, statistics, computer science, and bioinformatics/data science.  Successful curriculum design tends to create a strategy for biology education that is similar to long-standing strategies in fields such as physics or biochemistry with with an injection of practical computer science skills: two years of foundational courses that include mathematics through linear algebra and differential equations, basic chemistry, statistics, introduction to programming and algorithms, and biological fundamentals in areas such as organismal biology, genetics, and evolution.  This is typically followed by two years of a more focused track in biology, which make take on a molecular, ecological, evolutionary, organismal, or informatics specialization.  Learning together as undergraduates in a way that incorporates both computational and biological fundamentals before disciplinary specialization would likely create graduate students, postdocs, members of industry, and future faculty members who are better prepared to advance their fields and train others in a rapidly accelerating data-rich environment in the biosciences.

A few universities have been able to move in this direction, creating for example an undergraduate major in Biological Data Science; an example of one such curriculum is provided in a supplementary document (see OSU BDS curriculum).  Yet there are often administrative hurdles to appropriate program creation.  These include dispersal of the necessary teaching faculty across departments and colleges, creating non-conflicting course flows across these entities, and either creating new courses that either cross traditional disciplinary boundaries or incorporating biological examples into teaching settings where examples from physics are the the mainstay.  One approach with respect to creating a diverse student body in such a program is to lower the barriers of intimidation that may be associated with the traditional computational “cut-courses” in mathematics, statistics, and computer science.  Where these hurdles are currently challenging at the university level on a national scale, several ideas were put forward that could create helpful avenues for undergraduates:
Federal and/or local funding for skillsets (below) to be widely adopted in undergraduate biology courses -- working between professional educators, research faculty and support from administration for innovation.
Vehicle to encourage peer-peer learning/training to encourage interaction between computational students and biology students (i.e hackathons) and associated TA funding to promote these opportunities
Creation of special interest groups to integrate interdisciplinary education, for example “computational biology” dormitories placing biology students together with those from mathematics, statistics, and computer science.
Finally, the community agrees that the following “minimal skillsets” across the computational and biological sciences are fundamental:

    Computing and Statistics:
Command line and Unix environment
A scripting language (Perl/Python)
Database exposure: Mongo/MySQL
Software carpentry (best practices, proper commenting, version control etc/)
Statistical evaluation (ANOVAs, non-parametric tests, t-tests; useful for understanding how to set up an experiment so you can do the appropriate test)
R programming
Core competencies:
An understanding of what data are- how they’re generated, what they mean.
Data, meta-data
Scientific process: How to develop scientific questions and understand the fundamental differences in:
Descriptive
Exploratory
Hypothesis
Predictive
Experimental Design
How to phrase and test hypotheses
Being able to use computational tools for working effectively and reproducibly with data
Coding for data analysis, visualization and interpretation (Why is it done, what does it accomplish for you?)
Statistical Analysis
Statistics appropriate to biological systems

Skills and competencies needed for various positions:
-skills desired and bottlenecks encountered in terms of
There are currently major gaps in graduate education for preparing students for modern landscape of quantitative and collaborative biological research. Students are under-trained in core foundations of statistics, programming for data exploration and analysis, measurement theory for the sensors that collect quantitative data, and data visualization. We have recognized that one of the major bottlenecks to implementing this in graduate curriculum is balancing training with the time to do productive research and institutional resources.
Considering these constraints we have three possibilities for providing this training: (1) Workshops; (2) Short-courses; (3) Graduate-minor. The timing ...

The main challenge facing graduate education in 
 Grad minor: 
Biology. Molecular and Cell Biology, Genetics and Evolution, Organismal Biology
Computer science: see above and also clustering, classification, graph theory/networks, bioinformatic algorithms, ontologies and data resources
Mathematics: calculus refresher, linear algebra, differential equations
Statistics: probability computation, inference, hypothesis testing and correction for multiple testing, study design, distribution types, regression.
Integrated: capstone problem-solving course AND ethics and soft skills.
For computer scientists AND biologists: central dogma, basic molecular biology, genomics (RNA-seq, Y1H, sequencing...how these relate back to the central dogma- understanding the way things are measured can help e.g. with understanding why it might not be appropriate to merge specific data sets or matrices).
For computational biologists who are plant-curious: photosynthesis, plant physiology, genetics/breeding... 
Possible resources: 
Bioinformatic Data Skills (Vince Buffalo, O’Reiley; http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030157.do)
In the first year, mandatory trainings
NSF leverage
Understanding publications- how to write a good paper, a good thesis.
Where data should end up, how they’re formatted
d.     Should be integral in faculty education and training (particularly mid-career)?
Develop short courses for faculty
Faculty curriculum development- more awareness base and less skill-based.
1 day workshops for faculty, could be tie to Responsible Conduct for Research.
e.     Should be integral for those interested in industry/biotechnology? Ensure participation that accurately reflects diversity?
Team based projects:
Young entrepreneurs scheme- UK
iGEM- synthetic biology
DE has IGERT for engineered systems in cell; required internships where they addressed challenges posed by Industry.

graduate training fellowhips for training study; masters or certificates in a particular quantitative or biological emphasis after graduate school or after your bachelor’s; class size limitations - embracing small classes
Assessment: specific interview questions...how would you analyze these data etc? Journals regularly ask if you are able to evaluate the stats or need extra help. Good idea from Yellow Group: submissions to GitHub.
Skills generally useful (from our industry partner): teamwork, collaboration, communication, project management.

Postdoc
############

Postdoctoral trainees require skills and competencies in a variety of areas that are likely outside of their predoctoral area of scholarship. These include skills in project planning and management, collaboration, conflict resolution, effective communication and mentoring. Moreover, many postdocs will require retraining to acquire expertise in complementary scientific research areas. Postdocs who wish to retrain after completing their doctoral research, particularly in order to enter a new domain of science eg. transitioning between plant science and computational biology, will require extended periods of fellowship in order to accommodate the time required for the acquisition of new skills.
One of the major bottlenecks to achieving these competencies is the five year cap on postdoctoral research positions at many institutions.  In addition to these institutional constraints, many PIs are disinclined to encourage longer periods of retraining for postdoctoral researchers in their group because of the costs associated with the perceived “non-productive” periods of retraining. Possible solutions for overcoming these obstacles include providing the resources for postdoctoral participation in short courses that provide training in a particular competency, e.g. Alan Alda Centre for Communicating Science. Additionally, short fellowships, supported by government agencies, that support retraining senior postdocs transitioning into either PI or industrial research positions will be essential because for supporting postdoctoral researchers late career-independence transition postdocs, 



Postdoc career phase comes with expectation to make substantive public contributions. When this comes in the form of computational resources (web sites, services, downloadable programs, source code), need to recognize the difference between computational biology problems and software engineering problems. Postdocs are often leading development of resources, but rarely can fill both roles. Need to be able to identify resources to help mitigate whatever shortfalls they have. 

One of the consequences of the longer postdoctoral training, is the restriction of Mid term - Postdocs - course work coordination/coordinators as it relates to their particular project


Having a plan of responsibilities and credit from the very beginning - communicating clearly from all levels including the PI, grad students, postdocs - anyone in the project
Collaboration management plan
Consider a postdoc who moves between groups to facilitate integration of the projects

Faculty

For faculty, there is a recognition of the limitations in time and focus for learning new skills. Training recommendations are based on short-intensive training opportunities, online training or time set aside specifically to pursue the learning of these approaches and perspectives. Training for faculty may need to be more awareness based that skills based, as often faculty want to support these activities in their labs, understand better how to review papers or grants or formulate grants to appropriately include these approaches and are less focused on doing the analyses themselves. 
Short workshops could be developed to provide training to faculty on computational methods and how to conduct reproducible computational research. Attention could be paid to raising awareness for faculty on the true time and effort required to learn these skills and to utilize them in research activities. Some of this training, particularly in reproducible computational research, could be included in Responsible Conduct of Research training for biology-related faculty members.
Online training would also be a useful resource, as it could be done on a flexible time scale. Although online courses such as MOOCs have a low completion rate, these online materials could be short segments on particular topics, so no particular module would exceed one hour. Funding would be needed to develop these materials and there could also be some funding or incentives to support faculty spending their time on these activities. Broadening participation in re-training programs needs to be encouraged and supported. Training faculty in these approaches also has the benefit of them being able to train undergraduates and graduates and scale data and computational literacy. 
Additional strategies would be to provide sabbatical time to pursue interdisciplinary training. There could be some incentive to work on these topics during regular sabbatical time, or additional sabbatical opportunities or fellowships for this particular training. 
Finally there will need to be not only training, but public relations outreach to educate senior faculty about the diversity of approaches in computational/statistical approaches and their ability to answer biological questions in a novel fashion.

Industry
##############

Industry practice involves assembling multidisciplinary teams in which individual members bring the range of expertise and experience needed to tackle a project that will have an ultimate focus in business need.  The key attributes for industry are therefore for researchers with strong interpersonal skills in teamwork, collaboration, communication, and project management. Industry therefore requires individuals who are expert in one specific area but have the breadth of understanding that allows them to appreciate and respect the input of other disciplines to the overall project and the ability to function effectively with these other members. The nature of the scientific skills does not differ between academia and industry, but the depth of knowledge required across non-core skills may be different. Industry experience is however that computational scientists find the transition to working on biological more straightforward than the converse. Industry experience is however that computational scientists find the transition to working on biological more straightforward than the converse. The key requirement for biologists to be comfortable with computational approaches is shared, as is the need to be conversant with tools and quantitative approaches. Some biologists will clearly need to be more than conversant, but all need to have the minimum capacity to understand how computational and analytical methods can contribute to tackling complex biological problems. 
The specific computational training needs of industry is for biologists to be familiar with the use of a range of tools, such as leveraging various databases (28 DBs, SWISS-PROT, GO, NCBI, PPIs, gene expression…) linked to pathway information. Data come from many plants, but databases are seeded with a lot of Arabidopsis data, which is of particular utility for crops within the Brassicaceae. They also need to be able to use quantitative biology approaches such as the use of QTL analyses, and these aspects need to be built into undergraduate and graduate training programs.
The broader training needs for competency development may be best met by engaging with industry in different formats. For example, the European funding model encourages partnerships between researchers and industry (e.g., the bread wheat initiative that the French funding agency, INRA, puts money into, but so do companies like Syngenta; also the other funding modalities within the EU Horizon 2020 program). Increasing opportunities for public-private training and scientific partnerships leverages additional funding alongside public support, but more significantly in this context exposes the different cultures of academia and industry to each other’s ways of working to mutual advantage. Another model is for embedding Masters or PhD students in industry placements for 3-6 months, providing key insights and training opportunities at a formative stage and building skills. One example of this is the compulsory programme of the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) called “PIPS” (Professional Internships for PhD Students” http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/funding/filter/professional-internships/). UK experience is however that the acceptance of such programs does require mandating by funding agencies. A further UK program that operates at the postdoc and faculty level to promote training and exchange between industry and academic partners is the Flexible Interchange Program (FLIP; http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/funding/filter/flexible-interchange-programme/). One proposal made was for larger companies such as Pioneer/ Dupont/ Monsanto/ Syngenta to fund or co-fund some (small-ish) number of post-docs, perhaps along the lines of the Gates Foundation BREAD program, but for fellowships. A US example is an IGERT for Systems Biology of Cells in Engineered Environments (University of Delaware; http://www.igert.org/projects/288) which required internships where they addressed challenges posed by Industry. 
All of these approaches help to break down barriers and assist with one of the challenges identified which is the need to train PIs on the value of industry-based careers and how to effectively mentor their students for a career in industry.
Further types of activity that may be less directly focused on computational training for industry, but which develop the key skills identified as important by industry involve stimulating team based projects. iGEM (global undergraduate synthetic biology competition) is the outstanding multinational example, and the recent introduction of a plant stream within iGEM provides specific opportunities for plant scientists to engage, although is not specifically directed at computational skills. A team based Hackathon could be used with postdocs to teach skills of teamwork aimed at solving computational biology problems in plant sciences.
The UK also oragnises a BIotechnology Young Entrepreneurs Scheme (Biotechnology YES; http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/funding/filter/biotechnology-yes/) aimed at graduate students working in teams. Specific Masters courses that provide training in basic business and entrepreneurship skills for bioscientists also exist (http://www.ceb.cam.ac.uk/postgraduates-tab/mphil-mbe).



    -how to assess skills at each stage

General white-paper objectives- YOUR writing group topic is above
Outline case studies of challenges/bottlenecks for
biologists attempting to integrate bioinformatic, computational, quantitative approaches into their work.
purely quantitative, computational folks attempting to integrate biological; approaches into their work.
ideally some examples would include solutions, lessons learned. Perhaps there are examples from integrative centres like CPIB in the UK?
How much training in biology do computer scientists need?
Provide analysis of training and educational needs of the 21st century for computational and quantitative skills. - are there any broad categories (e.g. big data analysis, software engineering, computational modeling) that make sense to try to highlight?
Provide examples of national (and international) approaches and success
Develop recommendations on activities, approaches, etc.
Overarching topics for Focus Group and white paper (underlined text derived from grant project description):
What are the bioinformatics and computational skills needed by plant scientists of the 21st century to deal with more complex datasets (predictive, quantitative and theory-driven)?
What are the bottlenecks and/or disincentives to providing students with the needed skills?
Examples to illustrate how organizations have overcome bottlenecks?
Alternatively: examples where bottlenecks were avoided to begin with?
What do employers (of various types) need/want from employees; What are marketable skills in this area? Are academics at the “bleeding edge” in a good position to be able to define a set of skills that they think employers need or is it better to teach a broad skill set?

The consensus at this meeting was that the education of all levels of biology needs an overhaul to meet the demands of 21st biology. There is no escaping the necessity for quantitative and computational approaches to answer the most cutting edge biological questions. Yet there is a general resistance to the embrace of these techniques by the general plant biology community lead by Arabidopsis researchers. Below we outline ideas and recommendations for how to fill in the gaps in quantitative training at each level of a biological career stage.
