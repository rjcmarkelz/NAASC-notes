Session 1, Questions for discussion in breakout groups

There are perhaps two modes of training - training “biologists” to be more quantitative and training quantitative people to become more “experimental”. Is this a “problem” in plant biology today, and is it likely to still be the outcome of scientific training by 2026? Articulate your recommendations or aspirations in the short-term, mid-term and long-term with respect to the above statement AND what are the biggest hurdles that your institution faces with respect to each of these?

Are there common/viable means of training which can address (i) What are the best means of doing this? (ii) When should this training start? (iii) What kinds of resources are necessary to do this?
What are the minimum number of “skills” that each of these scientists should have to be more conversant in each of these topics? What core competencies should each have in order to be on track to be a scientist that embraces large-scale data and quantitative analyses? How do we assess this? Consider people at different stages in their (academic, government/public, or industry) career. Are any of these skills specific to plant biology?
Are there particular priorities that we feel: a) Funding agencies should know about (mid-term to long-term)?
b) Should be integral in undergraduate education?
c) Should be integral in graduate education?
d) Should be integral in faculty education and training (particularly mid-career)?
e) Should be integral for those interested in industry/biotechnology?\Ensure participation that accurately reflects diversity?

Session 3: Training Plant Biologists for High-throughput Phenotyping- Presentations and Panel Discussion
##############

Speakers: 5 minutes and 5 slides maximum*
Please be brief and keep to a maximum of 5 slides for your 5 minute presentation. Please present your work on the topics below and consider how it links to specific topics outlined in the questions and discussions points covered in Sessions 1 and 2.

*Some specific questions you might address include:

In a computational biology context- what specific training and skills were important to allow you to do the research you do? (broad or specific)
What skills did you find were easier to get through collaboration or via group members?
Are there any barriers that you still feel remain to be addressed (skills or collaborations)?
Reflections:
a. Past: Knowing what you know now, would you have done anything differently in how you got to where you are today (with respect to training, education, collaborations)?

b. Present: What would you recommend for students, researchers attempting similar efforts, (with respect to training, education, collaborations)?

c. Future: How do you see the field progressing in 5-10 years? Are there skills that you think will be needed to address unmet needs? I.e. are there areas that you feel need more focus to better enable the type of work that you do (with respect to training, education, collaborations)?

Questions for the discussion panel

3:10-3:25 pm: High throughput phenotyping requires a number of different skills: logistics of plantings, automation, keeping track of genotypes, plant care, robot care, a lot of computational expertise in image and subsequent statistical analyses, in addition to a basic understanding of plant physiology. Are there specific recommendations you have to groups contemplating this? Is it possible for one person to master everything or is it best to have experts for each of these?
3:25-3:40 pm: Even if the biologist who is interested in the outcome of the HTP experiment hands e.g. images off to an image analysis expert, is there an "Image Analysis for Dummies" book or some kind of crash guide that would help facilitate communication between domain experts? If there isn’t, what would the chapter titles be?
3:40-3:55 pm: Assuming a generalist can master all aspects, logistics seem to weigh more heavily in the planning of HTP experiments, more so if many parties are involved in a collaborative approach. Are there management approaches that can be employed to ease the logistics "pain"?
